# AI-Powered Guided First Contribution

## Summary

An AI-powered browser extension that uses **Agentic AI** and **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide intelligent, personalized guidance for first-time open-source contributors. The system leverages **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to orchestrate multiple AI agents that analyze repositories, understand user context, and provide dynamic, contextual assistance.

## Problem Statement + AI Opportunity

**Use Case:** New contributors to open-source projects often struggle to find a suitable "first issue" and navigate the contribution process.

Traditional "good first issue" discovery is static and one-size-fits-all. AI can revolutionize this by:

- **Intelligent Issue Analysis:** Understanding code complexity, not just labels
- **Personalized Guidance:** Adapting to individual skill levels and learning styles
- **Dynamic Documentation:** Generating contextual setup instructions
- **Smart Mentoring:** Providing real-time, contextual assistance throughout the contribution process

## MVP Scope

### Core AI Capabilities

- **Repository Intelligence Agent:** Analyzes codebase complexity, tech stack, and contribution patterns
- **Personalization Agent:** Learns user preferences and adapts recommendations
- **Guidance Agent:** Provides contextual, step-by-step assistance
- **Documentation RAG:** Intelligently parses and synthesizes project documentation
- **Code Analysis Agent:** Understands issue context and suggests implementation approaches
