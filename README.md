### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why do I need an OpenAI API key?**
A: The AI analysis features (difficulty assessment, repository intelligence, mentoring guidance) require advanced natural language processing that runs through OpenAI's models. This ensures high-quality, personalized recommendations.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes! Your API key and profile data are stored locally in Chrome's encrypted storage. The extension only communicates with GitHub's public API and OpenAI for analysis - no third-party tracking or data collection.

**Q: Can I use this without an API key?**
A: You can browse and discover issues using the basic GitHub search functionality, but the AI-powered features (difficulty analysis, personalization, mentoring) require an API key.

**Q: How much does OpenAI API usage cost?**
A: Very minimal! Most users spend less than $1/month. The extension is designed to be efficient with API calls and includes usage optimization features.
